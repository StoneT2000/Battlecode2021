# Battlecode 2021 - Team California Roll

This is my repository for my Battlecode 2021 code. 

My team name this year was California Roll and I soloed this year again and I made finals and got 9th! Unfortunately 4 rankings lower than last year, but again, RNG is the essense of Battlecode (this years winners, team babyducks, lost in the round of 16, only to then when ever single match from the loser's bracket to take home 1st place)

(note, although on the bc21 database it says my team name is Chop Suey but tldr; I didn't want to lose my ranking on the leaderboard because I wanted to change my team name).

My final submission is in `src/maxecosushi`. The bot names are a bit unintuitive in terms of what tournament I submitted them for but they are named after my current feelings / strategies at the time. More detailed in my postmortem soon on my [blog](https://www.stoneztao.com/blog/)

I'll also link other postmortems as they get posted around the internet / the battlecode discord

This code is very very messy. I'm not sure how helpful it is to read bot code, even amongst the other top bots, other than to learn about some of the neat bytecode optimizing tricks teams might employ. In my case, the only stand out "code" are my custom data structures that save a significant amount of bytecode (although they are far from perfect). Otherwise, have fun trying to understand my strategy! And feel free to attempt to compete against it
